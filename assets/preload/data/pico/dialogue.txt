:narrator:tamashadow: After what felt like a never ending night…
:narrator:tama: Both Pico and BF were quite easily the opposite of well rested.
:narrator:tamashadow: The two did not want to overstay their welcome however,
:narrator:tamashadow: and left the “house of horrors” which was a lot less scary in the daytime.
:narrator:tamashadow: On foot, they spent the better part of the morning heading across town to a local train station.
:narrator:tamashadow: The last thing they wanted to do was stick around long enough to get into even more trouble.
:pico:p4: …
:pico:p4: Where’s that damn train?!
:bf:b3: Relax...it’ll be here soon, I’m sure.
:pico:p4: It better come quick…
:pico:p4: We’ve already been set back twice.
:bf:b3: Yeah, I know.
:gf:default: BF!
:bf:b10:pico:p7: ?!
:gf:g2: I haven’t seen you in weeks!
:bf:b2: Heeeeeeeeeeeey GF...
:bf:b2: What’re you doing here...?
:gf:g3: Oh, you know, just out and about.
:gf:g4: …
:gf:g5: Heeeeeeey, you know what would be fun?
:gf:default: A duet! Just like old times!
:bf:b6: U-Uh, I’m sorry, I-I have to catch a train…
:gf:g2: We’ll be done before it shows up!
:gf:g5: I promise it’ll be quick, 
:gf:g6: and you know how I feel about promises!
:bf:b6: …
:bf:b6: Okay.
:pico:p4: Sukinsyn…
